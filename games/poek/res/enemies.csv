; player [base hp, per-lvl]: [100, 20]

; enemies:
; instead of evasion and stuff, that's added into the HP.
; instead of speed and stuff, that's added into the DMG.
; Why? ...
; ... If you have 30% more armor/damage reduction, thats basically the same as
;        having 30% more life. 30% chance to evade means take full damage with
;        a 30% chance of evading. Which is basically 30% more life. 
; ... If you attack faster, thats the same as doing a slow attack but a little
;       bit more. so take base damage (weak? hard?) and increase/decrease a bit
;       depending on speed.

; HP Examples:
; --- Is enemy hard to hit? add more HP. (flying, fast, underground, etc)
; --- Is enemy easy to hit? less HP. (big, slow)
; --- higher defense or pain tolerance? add more HP.
; DMG Examples:
; --- hit slow but hard? medium dmg (because slowness affects damage rate)
; --- hit fast but weak? medium dmg (because speed affects damage rate)
; --- hit fast but HARD? high dmg

; only hp and dmg values need to be changed
; |L = "increase per level"
